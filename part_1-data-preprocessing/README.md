Problem Statement:

Given a tabular data 'Data.csv' which consists of four parameters.
Country, Age, Salary and Purchased.

Find the variations between countries and purchases made by them with respective their salaries.

To Solve a machine learning model, we need to follow few steps:

1. Importing the appropriate libraries
2. Importing the dataset
3. Dealing with missing data in the dataset
4. Encoding the Categorical Data
5. Splitting the Data into Training_set and Test_set
6. Feature Scaling

We need to differentiate between independent variables and dependent variables
Identify the trend pattern by visualizing graphs between dependent and independent variables.
Finally predict the required outcomes by understanding the graphs.

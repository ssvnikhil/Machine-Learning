----------Simple Linear Regression-----------

Problem Statement:

How does a Person's Salary differ based on his Years of Experience?

Given 'Salary_Data.csv' which consists of two columns:
YearsExperience and Salary

We distinguish YearsExperience as independent variable and Salary as dependent variable and try to solve the problem.

So, to solve this type of problem we use Simple Linear Regression Model (y = mx + c)
Note: A Unit change in x affects change in y.

Simple Linear Regression uses the Best fitting line method to predict new results by using Ordinary Least Squares method.

There are even two graphs which explains machine has learned the model by training_set and its tested by test_set.
This explains how well the machine has understood the Simple Linear Regression Model.

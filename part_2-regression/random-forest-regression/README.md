----------Random Forest Regression-----------

Problem Statement:

A Human Resource team working for a big company wants to hire a new employee. So, while negotiating with the employee for his future salary he says he had more than 10 years of experience and was paid $160,000. Now the H.R guy acts as a detective agent to check whether the employee is providing the true data or not. So, he calls to employee's previous company and asks about his details. All the company provides is a data called 'Position_Salaries' and says the employee worked as a Region Manager for 2 years and it takes 4 years for a Region Manager to become a Partner. With this set of details the H.R guy builds a Machine Learning Model and tries to predict the employee's salary.

To solve this problem, we use Random Forest Regression Model. It is a Non-Linear and Non-Continuous Simple Regression.

Random Forest Regression is done by Ensemble learning. It is a team of decision tree regression each one making some predictions on dependent variable.
Ultimately the average of different predictions of all different trees in the forest is the predicted value.

While plotting the values of the dataset we can clearly see the pattern is split into several intervals.

We visualize the graphs by using higher resolution so as to have a clear non-continuous graph.

We try to predict the employee salary and the outcome hits the Bull's eye $160,333, which is the best prediction in all Regression Models

The H.R is happy with the result and even liked the employee for being truthful towards his previous payroll.

----------Support Vector Regression (SVR) -----------

Problem Statement:

A Human Resource team working for a big company wants to hire a new employee. So, while negotiating with the employee for his future salary he says he had more than 10 years of experience and was paid $160,000. Now the H.R guy acts as a detective agent to check whether the employee is providing the true data or not. So, he calls to employee's previous company and asks about his details. All the company provides is a data called 'Position_Salaries' and says the employee worked as a Region Manager for 2 years and it takes 4 years for a Region Manager to become a Partner. With this set of details the H.R guy builds a Machine Learning Model and tries to predict the employee's salary.

To solve this problem, we use Support Vector Regression Model. SVR is a non-linear Regression.
Non-Linear graph is any curve but not a straight line.

While plotting the values of the dataset we can clearly see the pattern is an exponential model which straight away rules out Linear Regression.

We try to build this model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) library and use Feature Scaling techniques in order to have better correlation between Levels and Salary.

We try to predict the employee salary and the outcome displays as $170,000, which we will consider as a good model

Therefore, He feels happy as the employee was truthful towards Salary information and hires him.

Problem Statement:

A mall which is famous in the city of Chennai contains information of its clients who has subscribed and have a membership card.
The Clients provided information such as Age, Salary and Annual Income when they have subscribed. 
Therefore, the mall has the purchase history of each of its client member and calculate the Spending Score of the individual clients.
It is nothing but amount of dollars they spent in a year and based on these values they computed a metric that takes values b/n 1 and 100.

So, the Mall gives this dataset of customers and asks to segment them into separate groups so as to identify the high Annual Income and has a high Spending score.
This can be solved using Clustering technique, but we have to identify into how many groups the data can be divided.
Two methods can be implemented: 1. K-Means Clustering and 2. Hierarchical Clustering

We can find the optimal number of Clusters and then visualize them to find our target
